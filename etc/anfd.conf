# Here a few examples:
#
# Defining a variable, e.g. for a network
# HOME_NETWORK=192.168.1.0/24
# or the same for a port list, e.g. for email:
# MAIL=465,993,143,25,110,587
# Port ranges are also allowed, like 1024-65536
#
# Allowing access to subdomains on a specific port e.g. for updates
# /usr/lib/apt/methods/http *.ubuntu.com:80
#
# Using a port list:
# /usr/lib/firefox/firefox *:80,443
#
# Space separated individual expressions are also fine
# /usr/bin/lynx *:80 *:443
#
# Allow access to a specific port and specific host:
# /usr/lib/git-core/git-remote-http github.com:443
#
# Allow access to all ports for an application that requires access to many ports and hosts (you might want to restrict that further, but you know this is just an example):
# /usr/bin/skype *
#
# A more complex rule may involve a couple of hosts and ports (note that $ADDONS contains a list of hosts and ports where the installed addons get their updates).
# /usr/lib/thunderbird/thunderbird $HOSTER1:$MAIL $HOSTER2:$MAIL $HOSTER3:$MAIL $ADDONS
#
# Allow full access to the home network (compare above):
# &.* $HOME_NETWORK
#
